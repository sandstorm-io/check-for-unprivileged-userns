    // Since I started this codebase by forking Keegan McAllister's

    // it in this program, but because while modifying this code, it
    // can be helpful to be able to write() it for debugging's sake.

    // unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER) works when we are not root. If we are already

    // We pass unshare()'s return code directly to exit(). It exits 0
    // in the case of success! And if the kernel gives us a non-zero
